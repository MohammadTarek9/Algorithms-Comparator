# Algorithms-Comparator
This project is a sorting algorithm comparator developed using Java. The comparisons are theoretical comparisons using number of steps in code and graphical comparisons.

## Features
1. Comparing between different algorithms 
2. Comparing an algorithm with its asymptotic efficiency
3. Comparing between algorithms using test files created by the user
4. Comparing between algorithms using test data entered through GUI

## Supported algorithms
1. Merge sort
2. Quick sort
3. Tree sort
4. Selection sort
5. Insertion sort
6. Bubble sort
7. Counting sort
8. Shell sort
9. Heap sort
